## Test Frontend

**NO TIME LIMIT, AND DELIVERY TIME WILL BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT**

In CornerJob, we like to listen to music at all hours. For this reason we need you to develop a web application to be able to assess the technical
part while still enjoying our favorite artists.

You have to create an app that consists in a simple navigation between two pages with CSS, HTML and vanilla Javascript (No frameworks or plugins).

On the first page we would see a search bar where you can enter the terms (whether artists, songs, albums, genres ...). The search results should
be listed on the same page, showing the song title and artist, and more in detail, the album title, release date, cover thumbnail, song length, genre
and price. It should offer the ability to sort the list over these last three fields.

Each result should navigate to a second page in which, with a similar design to current music players, allows us to see the cover detail, basic
information about the song and the basic controls to listen the song, play and pause, and skip to the previous and next song in the list of search
results.

Furthermore, this detail page should have a button that allow us to share what we are listening in our favorite social networks.
Send the project in a zip file or upload it to Github. We will not value the level of completion as primary, but the architecture and code styling, as
well as the adopted solutions, the use of design patterns or best practices will be what determines a good result.

To implement this test you will need to use the iTunes Search API

https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/

Here you will find a lot of documentation in addition to the necessary, so you can go directly to the sub-section called "Search Examples", and
verify that you only need to use a call like “https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=michael+jackson” for a search of the legendary Michael Jackson
songs. You will not need to use any additional parameters in the call. You can see at the bottom of this doc a response example (we have been
removed unnecessary fields).
